When a class having method with same name and different parameters then that is called as method overloading.
but when a class having method with same name and same parameters and if another class is also having method with same name and parameter and that class
should be the child class or sub class of the parent class then that will be called as method overriding.

example of method overloading:-

public class Demo{

	void funA(int i)
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA(int i) of Demo");
	}
	void funA()
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA()...")
	}
	
}

both of the methods are having same name bujt different parametrs and in th same class so overloading.


similarly for overriding:-


Demo.java
==============




// sub-class of A




public class Demo extends A{

	@overriding
	void funA(int i)
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA(int i) of Demo");
	}

	@overriding
	void funA()
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA()...")
	}
	
}

A.java
===========


//parent class


 
public class A{

	void funA(int i)
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA(int i) of A");
	}
	void funA()
	{
		System.out.println("Inside funA()...")
	}
	
}
