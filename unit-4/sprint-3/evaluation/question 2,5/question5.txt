Question 5) 


								interface A{
								int i = 111;
										}
								class B implements A{
								void methodB(){
								i = 222;
										}
			
						}

this program will not run because we have impemented interface of A into B class within A i=111; and this i will act as final which cannot be reassined to any other value;
we are trying to change the value of i in class B with as method so this cannot be done.
