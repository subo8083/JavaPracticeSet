Q3) Diffference between comparable and comparator:




comparable     
===================                                                             
 
1) comparable provides the single sorting sequence , in other words we can sort selection on the basis of a single element such as Id,name,or price;

2) Comparable effects the original class, i.e, the actual class is modified.

3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.

4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.




comparator 
===================

1) The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.

2) Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.

3) Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.

4) A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
