1) Marker Interface:

		

	one class can extends another class and implements multiple interfaces simultaneously.
but we can have empty interface also,

example:    

class A{									interface X{
											
											}
	
	

}


		and this type of interface is also known as tag or marker interfaces.

some of the predefined marker interfaces in java are:

	java.io.Serialization;
	java.lang.Clonable;

these type of marker interfaces used to specify certain type of special behaviour of object.



2) multiple inheritance is not supported by java in class level because of ambiguity, since when one class inherit property of second second class and third class  and if both
the classes have same property then compiler will get confuse which property to inherit.
suppose class B inherit class A and Class C also and both class B and class C has same method called display(); then compiler will get confuse which display method it will
inherit but in case of interface java supports multiple inheritance.
