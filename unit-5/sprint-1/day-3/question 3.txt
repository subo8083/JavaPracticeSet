Exceptions in java are the the objects of some classes(Predefined classes) created by JVM to represent the corresponding logical error.

Basically there are two types of errors in java:
1) syntactical error
2) logical error

for each logical error there is some pre defined claases in java, whose object willl be created by the jVM whenever it encounters that corresponding logical error.

example:

java.lang.ArithmeticException: This type of exception occur when user try to give wrong inputs like if user try to divide given number to 0 then this will occur.

java.lang.NullPointerException: This type of exception occur when user try to access the methods using null type of object.

java.lang.ClassCastException: If the user try to access Another class object using different type of object which does not belong to the same class i.e not instance of that class object.

java.lang.ArrayOutOfBoundException: if user try to access the index of array which is not allocated in the array then this type of error occurs.

java.lang.NumberMismatchException: If user try to access Number using String object then this type of error occurs.
