Q)3
		

	there are three relationship exist in tables:
	
1)One to one: It involves the relationship between one table to another but it should not be duplicated.
	for example: one person having a single driving license , multiple driving license is not allowed in case of one
 to one, so to make this unique we need to mention id as unique in person,

another example is the person and adhar card as single person is having single adhar card.

eg
=======

	create table Person(pid int primary key, pname varchar(12),address varchar(12));
	create table DL(dlid int primary key, issueDate varchar(12),expDate varchar(12),personId int unique, foreign key(personId) references Person(pid));

	here we made unique in personID as duplicate can be avoided;

2) One to many: it establishes relation between one table to many tables , for example in the above example if we reomve 
the unique keyword then duplicate will be posssible so it can be made as One to many type.


3) MAny to Many: It establishes the relation between many tables, for example one teacher could have
many students or one students could have many teachers.
